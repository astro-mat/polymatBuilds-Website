I got married once. We did it at the house. In preparation, instead of spending loads on stuff we wouldn't ever use again, we decided to spend on useful things. As It rains a lot in the north-west of Ireland, A principle concern was staying dry. We decided to make a veranda with seating and bar area.

I had previously spent some time researching similar outdoor areas and it is amazing how many different ways there are to do it. I came up with this simple structure with corrugated plastic covering.

My Dad came to help with preparations and it became a nice little Father-son Project.

Here are some images it being used before the Wedding 

I didn't seem to get any real pictures of the final structure. Here are some from 2026. It needs to be tidied up a bit

The roof is leaking a bit. I think I need to take the sheets off, re-fit them and over lap them more. It has been a great feature of the house and has been used a lot.
